# joy-unity
Sandbox unity project with random things. Currently setting up sample scenes in a project using Unity's [High-Definition Render Pipeline](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/03/16/the-high-definition-render-pipeline-focused-on-visual-quality). Eventually, neat things will be done I think. I don't have a ton of time for side-projects what with the contracting and [**the company**](https://joy-machine.com) and the [**_game thing_**](http://steel-hunters.com), but a little side-project every now and when-you-wake-up-at-5am-for-no-reason is good for you.

For now, though: just scene setup and sample assets.

## Grabbing from Git.
For cloning, either:
  1) **Use** `git clone https://github.com/trentpolack/joy-unity.git --recursive` **to initialize submodules upon cloning**.
  2) Or, if you really just hate that idea, once you clone the repo be sure to initialize and update submodules (`git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update` -- both in the repo root folder.

## Sandbox Scenes
### Old-School Sponza
I haven't actually done anything interesting whatsoever yet; I've just been playing with changes to Unity since I last used it. Also, to keep this MIT-licensed, I don't get to use any of my more pretty and fancy samples.

So there are all the standards in there: stanford bunny, the cornell box, mori_knob, and [SPONZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponza_Palace) (two versions, even). Here's a quick stab at a sandbox scene with `sponza_01`:

It's brought to you in a lovely shade of desaturated-_Quake_ and... Well. That's it really. Not big on colors that palace.
